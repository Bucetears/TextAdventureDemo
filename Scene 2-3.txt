“Let’s go to that game shop. I left my console and games at home so let’s get some new ones.” Erik took the lead over to a video game store. May looked a bit surprised, and she looked even more confused when they entered the store and Erik started checking out which games they had.
“Why are you looking at these little plastic boxes? The only difference is the art on them, and they aren’t big enough to hold anything.” May pulled a game case off of the shelf and opened it up to see nothing. She glared at the case in response.
“Do you seriously not know what video games are?”
She didn’t respond and just glared at him. He took that as a yes.
“They’re-” He went to say something, but then he remembered her flip phone. There is a good chance she doesn’t know anything about technology. He tried to remember if there was even a TV in her apartment. 
“Do you have a TV?”
“Is that like a disease or something?”
“No, but TB stands for tuberculosis which is.”
She seemed even more confused after that.
“All you need to know is that video games are a type of game that uses technology. They’re fun.” He said they were fun, but really when was the last time he actually had fun playing a video game? He just used them to pass time and to distract him from everything else going on in his life.
“You don’t sound very sure of that.” She let out a sigh. “However, if you want to buy them we might as well.” She put the case back on the shelf in the wrong spot and squatted down next to him. 
He was a little embarrassed at first, but he soon got over it. May didn’t expect anything from him. She chose him, and she would stay by him no matter what he did. There didn’t need to be any understanding or even any affection between them. All they needed was to be by someone else’s side, and they could do that for each other. It was comforting.
