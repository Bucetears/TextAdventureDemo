When they got to the beach, it was actually still cold. May made it sound like they were going to somewhere with a warmer climate, but apparently she changed her mind. Erik held his arms together tightly to keep as much body warmth as possible. May on the other hand was splashing around in the water like it was nothing.
“I should have brought Poseidon!” She called out to him. Honestly he didn’t think Poseidon would enjoy this weather much more than he did, but maybe he just tended to project onto Poseidon because he believed he was the only normal person around him. Really he was an octopus not a person. Erik was embarrassed that he was projecting onto an octopus of all things. 
“Are you going to come in?”
“No!”
“Come in!”
Even though they were talking to each other, could it even be considered a conversation?
“Come in!” She demanded him again. “I’ll warm you up!”
“With magic or are you trying to come onto me?”
“With magic of course. How stupid are you? Whatever the other thing you said isn’t real, that’s just a bunch of words together.”
Erik timidly approached her. “I was asking if you were flirting with me.”
“Flirting?”
“How innocent are you?”
“Flirting is when you’re being lovey dovey in front of people right?”
“It doesn’t have to be in front of other people.”
“Oh, well trust me Erik, that’s never going to happen.” She laughed scornfully at him. It’s not like he wanted to enter that kind of relationship with her. She grabbed onto him and pulled into the water. His shoes filled with icy cold water and they became heavy.
