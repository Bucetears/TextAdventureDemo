“Just let her go, May.” Erik sighed as he looked away. May let out a loud sigh, but then the air filled with a loud cracking noise and his mom’s scream. He turned back to see his mom on the ground grabbed her wrist, which was completely shattered while May stood idly by.
“M-Mom…” He reached out for her, but she smacked his hand away.
“Just go. You rotten child, get out of here and never come back.” He opened his mouth to ask her why and how, but he couldn’t. Mom hated him, and she always had. There was nothing left for him here in this household.
“Let’s go May…” May glared down at his mom, but obediently followed him out his house. He was never coming back here again.
