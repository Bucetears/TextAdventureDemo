“Why are you on bad terms with the others?”
“I never said bad terms, just not good ones.” May glared at him. “Isaac and Emily wanted to live in a bigger house together. Darla ran off and got married. So we’re not involved in each other’s lives anymore.”
She said there were four necromancers… actually she said four plus one, but Erik assumed that plus one wasn’t friends with her. However she just mentioned three of them.
“What about the fourth necromancer?” He asked before he could shut himself up.
“That’s a great question, Erik!” May turned to Mas with an innocent smile that somehow felt malicious. “Mas surely you can answer Erik’s question right?”
“Shut up you vile woman. If you had no intention of keeping your end of the deal, then don’t drag me into it.” His response caused a sour expression to come onto May’s face.
“If you haven’t noticed, I have been keeping my end of the deal.” she snarled back at him. “Sheesh Mas, it was just a question. You don’t have to start bringing up the past all of the sudden.” May regained her cool rather quickly as she let out a sigh. “Sorry Erik, apparently Mas is too much of a drama king to answer your question.”
“To be frank, I didn’t actually care that much about the answer.” Erik felt that saying that would somehow defuse the situation, but the air was still incredibly tense. This was going to be a long car drive.
