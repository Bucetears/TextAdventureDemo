“Oh we’ve known each other for so long now!” May clapped her hands together happily as she leaned back in her seat. “I was four when I met Seth and Isaac. I was six when I met Darla. I was fifteen when Emily joined us, and we had been together since we each met each other. Emily is the only one younger than me, well except you are younger than me now, but at the time it was so fun all together.”
“Really?” Mas grunted.
“Really!” May repeated. “My memory is pretty really spotty, but those were… good days.”
“Where are the others now?”
“Isaac and Emily are living together. Those two were always the best of friends. Darla is… well I don’t have a clue where she is, but she’s married. So she’s probably somewhere pretending to play house.” May scoffed and shook her head.
“And Seth?”
May tapped her chin and looked up at the ceiling with a stupid look on her face. “Huh? Seth?” her eyes immediately went to Mas. “Say Mas, what about Seth? I wonder where he could possibly be.”
“Stop acting like a moron. You know I can’t tell you that.” Mas grunted back with a sharp glare aimed at May.
“Huh.” May said in such a bland manner. “Well you heard it from this guy. Apparently nobody knows.” she shrugged in a dramatic manner. Erik felt there was more going on than either of them were saying, but he knew he couldn’t just ask.
