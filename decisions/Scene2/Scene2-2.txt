“It’s weird seeing you so loving.” Erik let out a sigh as he sat down on the couch.
“Weird?” She tilted her head at him as she pulled the octopus off of her head. “Wouldn’t it be more weird to a boring person like you to see an octopus who willingly comes out of its tank and wraps itself around the head of its owner?”
Erik pouted at her as she cuddled with the octopus. “No, you being nice is definitely the more weird thing.”
“Then maybe YOU’RE weird!” She laughed to herself as if she said something clever. “But Erik is a necromancer, so his mind doesn’t work like other boring people’s minds so that makes sense.”
“I don’t think someone like you has the right to determine what is weird and what is not.”
“Maybe, but why would you have that right? You’re barely an adult. You are weak willed and pathetic. You aren’t smart. You aren’t even handsome. If anything you have less right than me, who is strong and beautiful.” She returned the octopus to the cage.
