“When you say you stopped playing games are you talking about games like hide and seek or tag?” Erik tried to understand where her weird mind was going.
“Yes. We also played shoots and ladders.”
“These are a different type of game. Even though you stopped playing those types of games as a kid, there are many types of games with plenty aimed at adults.”
May blinked as she tried to understand what he was talking about.
“Like hide and seek with murder?”
“No, that's a horror movie plot.”
“Oh. That makes sense. You don’t need to be an adult to be a murderer after all.”
She did not get what he was saying in the slightest.
“Well, do you know what a casino is?”
“Yeah! Seth used to like going there.” She giggled happily. “That was when he smoked. Sometimes we’d go together.”
He had a feeling he did not want to know the details of that story.
“Well casinos are basically just places where adults play adult games together.”
“Huh.” May seemed to get what he was talking about now. “So you basically just set up a casino in my home huh? I only liked going to the casino because I was going with Seth, so take it down.”
“No it’s not a mini casino!” His morning of work was not going to be wasted because she was dumb! “The games played in casinos are based around luck and making money. These games however are based around skill and having fun. So much better than anything a casino could offer.” He said that, but he had never been to a casino.
“Oh! Then you don’t have to take it down.”
He wasn’t going to even if she asked.
