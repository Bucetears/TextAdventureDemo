“May these games aren’t for kids. All you have to do is check the rating of the game.” Erik pulled out one of his video games cases and pointed at the rating on the back. “You see that ‘M’ there, that stands for mature. That means the game is recommended for adults.”
“Huh?” She tilted her head at him.
“You see the video game industry has made a rating system for video games to rate how intense the content in the game is. That way people can know what offensive things may appear in the game and that people can avoid buying games that may include things that aren’t suited for certain audiences. They use these different letters to inform the buyer of the type of content or maturity rating of the game. You understand?”
“Yes.” She nodded with hesitation. He highly doubted she did. “Poseidon, Erik is talking nonsense, but maybe if we agree he’ll stop talking about it.”
Erik let out a sigh, and decided to give up on explaining it.
