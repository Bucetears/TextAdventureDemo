“Luck is not actually real though. What happens to you is based on all the actions of the people around you.” Erik quickly put the game in the console. “That woman controlled my life before, and now you control my life now.” Either way it looked like he was fated to be toyed with by women.
“You’d give your life over to me to control?”
“I never had the ability to give it anyways. You stole me away from that woman and so you stole the right to do with me as you please with it.”
“What a tempress you make me out to be! I never stole a man a single day of my life. Men simply come to me and ask to be played with.”
“Then maybe it could be said that you stole their hearts?”
“I didn’t steal his heart!” She sounded offended. “It belonged to me to start with. No, he gave it to me! He really did! He just wasn’t honest, so I took matters into my own hands!”
“Whatever you say. Frankly I couldn’t care less about your lovers and previous escapades.”
“You know nothing of love do you, Erik?” She pouted.
“Of course not. I don’t know the love of a parent, the love of a friend, and certainly not the love of a woman. And I’d rather keep it that way then get involved in whatever you consider love.”
