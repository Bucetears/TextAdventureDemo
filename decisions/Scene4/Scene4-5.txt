May usually bossed him around, but not usually like this. He couldn’t help, but obey her. It felt kind of good to be desired in such a way. She didn’t want this kiss out of love or commitment, but just as a way to forget the pain a little. He liked that idea. He leaned up to her and placed a shy kiss on her lips.
